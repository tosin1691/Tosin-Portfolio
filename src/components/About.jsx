                Hi! I'm Tosin! I am a chartered accountant turned FrontEnd Developer from London, England. 
                </p>
                <p>
                My interest for web development stems from my passion for problem solving. The feeling of a great sense of success after solving a complex problem is indescribable and I look forward to working in a field that greatly links with my passion. I have recently completed a Frontend Web Development bootcamp certification program at edX Online, where I developed and enhanced my skills in HTML & CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, React.JS, and responsive web design. I thoroughly enjoyed collaborating with my peers to bring our software visions to life.
