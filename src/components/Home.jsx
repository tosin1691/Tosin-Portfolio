            <p>
               To adapt to the current time and contribute to using technologies to improve our everyday lives, I have spent the past few years learning how to code and I have acquired new skills and built some interesting projects in the process. Currently I am focused sharpening and expanding my skillset as a FrontEnd Developer and I am excited at the prospect of starting a career in the field.
